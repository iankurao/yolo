# Explanation of Docker Setup

## 1. Choice of Base Image

### Frontend (Client)

For the frontend application, I chose the `node:14` image as the base. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:
- **Compatibility**: Node.js version 14 is stable and widely supported, ensuring compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
- **Community Support**: Official Node.js images are regularly updated and maintained by the Node.js community, ensuring security patches and updates.
- **Size and Performance**: The Node.js slim variant (`node:14-slim`) was considered for its smaller size, but for development and ease of use, the standard `node:14` variant was chosen.
