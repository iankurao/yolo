# Explanation of Docker Setup

## 1. Choice of Base Image

### Frontend (Client)

For the frontend application, I chose the `node:14` image as the base. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:
- **Compatibility**: Node.js version 14 is stable and widely supported, ensuring compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
- **Community Support**: Official Node.js images are regularly updated and maintained by the Node.js community, ensuring security patches and updates.
- **Size and Performance**: The Node.js slim variant (`node:14-slim`) was considered for its smaller size, but for development and ease of use, the standard `node:14` variant was chosen.

### Backend

Similarly, for the backend application, I opted for the `node:14` image:
- **Consistency**: Using the same base image (`node:14`) for both frontend and backend ensures consistency in the development and deployment environment.
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Node.js provides a robust environment for JavaScript-based server applications, suitable for building scalable backend services.
- **Version Stability**: Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support) version 14 ensures stability and long-term compatibility for production-grade applications.


## 2. Dockerfile Directives

### Frontend (Client)

The Dockerfile for the frontend (`client/Dockerfile`) includes the following directives:
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory to `/app` within the container.
- **COPY**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first to leverage Docker's layer caching mechanism.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs Node.js dependencies defined in `package.json`.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the rest of the application code into the container.
- **EXPOSE 3000**: Exposes port 3000 to allow external communication.
- **CMD ["npm", "start"]**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which starts the React application.

### Backend

The Dockerfile for the backend (`backend/Dockerfile`) includes similar directives:
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
- **COPY**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to facilitate efficient dependency installation.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs backend dependencies.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the backend application code into the container.
- **EXPOSE 3001**: Exposes port 3001 for external access to the backend service.
- **CMD ["npm", "start"]**: Defines the command to start the backend server upon container startup.
