# Explanation of Docker Setup

## 1. Choice of Base Image

### Frontend (Client)

For the frontend application, I chose the `node:14` image as the base. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:
- **Compatibility**: Node.js version 14 is stable and widely supported, ensuring compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
- **Community Support**: Official Node.js images are regularly updated and maintained by the Node.js community, ensuring security patches and updates.
- **Size and Performance**: The Node.js slim variant (`node:14-slim`) was considered for its smaller size, but for development and ease of use, the standard `node:14` variant was chosen.

### Backend

Similarly, for the backend application, I opted for the `node:14` image:
- **Consistency**: Using the same base image (`node:14`) for both frontend and backend ensures consistency in the development and deployment environment.
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Node.js provides a robust environment for JavaScript-based server applications, suitable for building scalable backend services.
- **Version Stability**: Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support) version 14 ensures stability and long-term compatibility for production-grade applications.
