# Explanation of Docker Setup

## 1. Choice of Base Image

### Frontend (Client)

For the frontend application, I chose the `node:14` image as the base. Here's the reasoning behind this choice:
- **Compatibility**: Node.js version 14 is stable and widely supported, ensuring compatibility with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
- **Community Support**: Official Node.js images are regularly updated and maintained by the Node.js community, ensuring security patches and updates.
- **Size and Performance**: The Node.js slim variant (`node:14-slim`) was considered for its smaller size, but for development and ease of use, the standard `node:14` variant was chosen.

### Backend

Similarly, for the backend application, I opted for the `node:14` image:
- **Consistency**: Using the same base image (`node:14`) for both frontend and backend ensures consistency in the development and deployment environment.
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Node.js provides a robust environment for JavaScript-based server applications, suitable for building scalable backend services.
- **Version Stability**: Node.js LTS (Long-Term Support) version 14 ensures stability and long-term compatibility for production-grade applications.


## 2. Dockerfile Directives

### Frontend (Client)

The Dockerfile for the frontend (`client/Dockerfile`) includes the following directives:
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory to `/app` within the container.
- **COPY**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first to leverage Docker's layer caching mechanism.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs Node.js dependencies defined in `package.json`.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the rest of the application code into the container.
- **EXPOSE 3000**: Exposes port 3000 to allow external communication.
- **CMD ["npm", "start"]**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which starts the React application.

### Backend

The Dockerfile for the backend (`backend/Dockerfile`) includes similar directives:
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory to `/app`.
- **COPY**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to facilitate efficient dependency installation.
- **RUN npm install**: Installs backend dependencies.
- **COPY . .**: Copies the backend application code into the container.
- **EXPOSE 3001**: Exposes port 3001 for external access to the backend service.
- **CMD ["npm", "start"]**: Defines the command to start the backend server upon container startup.

## 3. Docker-compose Networking

### Application Port Allocation

In `docker-compose.yml`, ports are allocated as follows:
- **Client**: Port `3000` on the host is mapped to port `3000` on the frontend container.
- **Backend**: Port `3001` on the host is mapped to port `3001` on the backend container.
- **MongoDB**: Port `27017` on the host is mapped to port `27017` on the MongoDB container.

### Bridge Network Implementation

By default, Docker Compose creates a default network (`bridge` network) for all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This allows containers to communicate with each other using service names as hostnames (`client`, `backend`, `mongo`).

## 4. Docker-compose Volume Definition and Usage

### MongoDB Volume

Volumes are defined in `docker-compose.yml` to persist MongoDB data:
- **Volumes**: `mongo-data` volume is defined to persist MongoDB data at `/data/db` within the MongoDB container.

### Usage

- MongoDB container (`mongo`) uses the `mongo-data` volume to store and persist database files (`/data/db`) across container restarts, ensuring data persistence.

## 5. Git Workflow

### Workflow Description

The Git workflow used to achieve the task involved:
- **Repository Initialization**: Initializing a Git repository in the project root.
- **Commit Strategy**: Making frequent, descriptive commits throughout development.
- **Branch Management**: Using feature branches (`docker-setup`, `feature/add-product`) for new development and merging them into `master` after code review.
- **Version Control**: Tagging releases (`v1.0`, `v1.1`) in Git to track stable versions of the application.
- **Collaboration**: Using pull requests for code reviews and collaboration with team members.

## 6. Successful Running of Applications and Debugging Measures

### Deployment Success

The applications (`frontend`, `backend`, `mongodb`) were successfully deployed using Docker Compose:
- **Testing**: Thorough testing was conducted locally to ensure correct container interaction and application functionality.
- **Debugging**: Common Docker issues such as network configuration, volume mounting, and container connectivity were resolved using Docker logs (`docker logs <container_name>`), inspecting network configurations, and Docker Compose troubleshooting.

## 7. Docker Image Tag Naming Standards

### Naming Strategy

Docker images were tagged with:
- **Semantic Versioning**: Following the `semantic versioning` standard (`v1.0`, `v1.1`) to denote stable releases.
- **Latest Tag**: A `latest` tag was applied to the most recent stable release for ease of reference (`v1.1`).



# IP3 Configuration Management 

### Configuration Management

Ansible is used for configuration management and application deployment. 

The playbook is located in the ansible directory and defines tasks to set up Docker containers for the client and backend services.

Roles: Each container is configured in its own unique role for modularity and reusability.
Variables: Variables are used for configuration values to make the playbook flexible and easy to manage.
Blocks and Tags: Tasks are grouped using blocks and tags for better organization and ease of execution.

# Explanation

## Stage 1: Ansible Instrumentation

### Choice of Base Image
We chose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as the base image for its stability and compatibility with Docker and Node.js.

### Dockerfile Directives
- `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
- `RUN`: Executes commands to set up the environment.
- `COPY`: Copies files from the local filesystem into the container.
- `CMD`: Specifies the command to run the application.

### Docker-Compose Networking
Docker-compose sets up a bridge network to allow communication between containers. Ports are allocated to expose services.

### Docker-Compose Volume
Volumes are used to persist data, especially for MongoDB, ensuring data persistence across container restarts.

### Git Workflow
- Regular commits with descriptive messages.

## Stage 2: Ansible and Terraform Instrumentation
